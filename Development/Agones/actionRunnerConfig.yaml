spec:
  # the number of GameServers to keep Ready or Allocated in this Fleet
  replicas: 1
  # defines how GameServers are organised across the cluster.
  # Options include:
  # "Packed" (default) is aimed at dynamic Kubernetes clusters, such as cloud providers, wherein we want to bin pack
  # resources
  # "Distributed" is aimed at static Kubernetes clusters, wherein we want to distribute resources across the entire
  # cluster
  scheduling: Distributed
  # a GameServer template - see:
  # https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/ for all the options
  strategy:
    # The replacement strategy for when the GameServer template is changed. Default option is "RollingUpdate",
    # "RollingUpdate" will increment by maxSurge value on each iteration, while decrementing by maxUnavailable on each
    # iteration, until all GameServers have been switched from one version to another.
    # "Recreate" terminates all non-allocated GameServers, and starts up a new set with the new details to replace them.
    type: RollingUpdate
    # Only relevant when `type: RollingUpdate`
    rollingUpdate:
      # the amount to increment the new GameServers by. Defaults to 25%
      maxSurge: 25%
      # the amount to decrements GameServers by. Defaults to 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%

        # portPolicy has three options:
        # - "Dynamic" (default) the system allocates a free hostPort for the gameserver, for game clients to connect to
        # - "Static", user defines the hostPort that the game client will connect to. Then onus is on the user to ensure that the
        # port is available. When static is the policy specified, `hostPort` is required to be populated
        # - "Passthrough" dynamically sets the `containerPort` to the same value as the dynamically selected hostPort.
        #      This will mean that users will need to lookup what port has been opened through the server side SDK.
        portPolicy: Passthrough
        # The name of the container to open the port on. Defaults to the game server container if omitted or empty.

        # Disable health checking. defaults to false, but can be set to true
